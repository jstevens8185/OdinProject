        <h1>How to learn guitar for noobs</h1>
        
        <p>So you want to learn guitar, huh? Well you've come to the right place. Sit down, grab a drink, and buckle up
            because this is going to be a bumpy ride. <em>Oh?</em> You don't drink? Suit yourself. I'll have an extra 
            for you.
        </p>

        <h2>Prepare yourself.</h2>

        <p>Before we can begin the journey of becoming a guitarist there are some things we must consider.</p>
        <p>The most important of these being this: <em><strong>YOU MUST OWN A GUITAR!</strong></em></p>
        <p>I can't even begin to explain how many have sought me out only to be turned away because they thought
            that I would give them the tools they need. <em>How silly of them to assume such things!</em>
        </p>
        <p>Yes, you must own (or perhaps rent) your instrument. Only then can we move on to requirement number two: 
            <em><strong>KNOW WHY YOU WANT TO LEARN GUITAR!</strong></em>
        </p>
        <p>Everyone has their own reason for learning. It may be to get more ladies. It may be to win your fathers approval.
            My reason was because I got grounded when I was 12 years old and a guitar was the only thing left in my room for 
            a month. <em>It doesn't matter what your reason is <strong>as long as you have one.</strong></em>
